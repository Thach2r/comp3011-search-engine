# COMP3011 Search Engine

A command-line search engine that crawls [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com), builds an inverted index, and supports ranked search queries using TF-IDF scoring.

## Features

- Crawls all pages of a website with a 6-second politeness window
- Builds an inverted index storing word frequency and position data
- Supports single and multi-word search queries (AND logic)
- Ranks results using TF-IDF scoring
- Saves and loads index from disk
- Displays snippet preview showing context around matching words

### Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `build` | Crawl website and build index | `> build` |
| `load` | Load existing index from disk | `> load` |
| `print <word>` | Show index entry for a word | `> print good` |
| `find <query>` | Find pages containing all query words, with snippet preview | `> find good friends` |
| `quit` | Exit the program | `> quit` |

### Example Session

```text
load
Index loaded. 4570 unique words.

print indifference
Word: 'indifference' — found in 11 page(s)

find good friends
Found 34 page(s) containing ['good', 'friends']:

1. https://quotes.toscrape.com/tag/contentment/page/1 Score: 1.3111 ...

quit
Goodbye.
```

## Design Decisions & Complexity Analysis

### Data Structure: Nested Dictionary

The inverted index uses a nested dictionary structure:

```python
{word: {url: {count: int, positions: list[int]}}}
```

- **Lookup complexity: O(1)** — Python dictionaries use hash tables, so looking up any word is constant time regardless of index size.
- **Trade-off:** Higher memory usage compared to a database like SQLite, but acceptable for this dataset size (4,570 words, 214 pages). SQLite would reduce memory but increase lookup latency.

### Crawling: Set-based Visited Tracking

Using a `set` for visited URLs ensures O(1) membership checks, preventing duplicate crawls efficiently.

### Search Ranking: TF-IDF

Results are ranked using TF-IDF scoring:

- **TF (Term Frequency):** rewards pages where the query word appears often
- **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency):** penalises words that appear across many pages, boosting rare/specific terms
- **Trade-off:** TF-IDF is simpler than BM25 or neural ranking, but performs well for this dataset and is fully explainable.

### Storage: JSON vs SQLite

Index is stored as JSON for simplicity and human-readability.

- **JSON:** fast to load, easy to inspect, no dependencies
- **SQLite alternative:** lower memory, supports concurrent access, but adds complexity and slower for full-index loads
